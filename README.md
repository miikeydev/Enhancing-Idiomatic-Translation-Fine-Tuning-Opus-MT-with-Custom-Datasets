# Enhancing-Idiomatic-Translation-Fine-Tuning-Opus-MT-with-Custom-Datasets

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the advanced fine-tuning of the Opus-MT model from the University of Helsinki, specifically tailored for idiomatic translation tasks. This project meticulously documents the creation and augmentation of a custom dataset using OpenAI's API, transforming a pre-trained model to accurately handle idiomatic expressions while maintaining high-quality standard translations. Detailed instructions include data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation methods, offering a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging transfer learning for precise natural language processing. Explore the full methodology and results, and gain insights into optimizing translation models for specialized linguistic nuances. I also made a medium article for more precisions :)

Unfortunately, I cannot provide the model weights through GitHub as it does not accept files of this size. However, if you would like to obtain them, please do not hesitate to contact me, and I will be happy to provide them to you.
